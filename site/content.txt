Welcome to the official 3DS Homebrew Launcher website ! This page is meant to be a hub between all the best and newest ways to get homebrew running on your system.

- What is homebrew ?

	Homebrew is what we call unofficial software made by amateur developers for closed systems such as the 3DS. This includes both games and applications, and in practice getting homebrew on your 3DS means you'll be able to :

		- Play cool games such as Aperture Science 3D, a free (and still work-in-progress) adaptation of Portal for the 3DS.
		- Play out-of-region games you own.
		- Make your own themes to use in home menu.
		- Play old SNES games in blargSNES.

- How do I get homebrew running on my console ?

	Getting homebrew on your 3DS has never been easier ! All you need is one or more of the following titles and a bit of patience :

		- YouTube
			In order to install tubehax, you will need a console whose firmware version is between 9.0 and 9.9, as well as the YouTube application (available for free on eShop) and an internet connection.

			1. First go down to the "preparing your SD card" section and follow those steps, then come back. Don't worry, we'll wait for you !

			NOTE : the following steps might be slightly confusing to some people. If you find you're not sure what the steps are referring to, please just head over to the Youtube video showing them being executed here.

			2. On your 3DS, open the System Settings app, then go to Internet Settings and Connection Settings. From there, select your favorite Connection, tap the Change Settings button, and on the second page head over to the DNS section. Once there, select "No" for "Auto-obtain DNS", and under Detailed Setup, enter the following address : 107.211.140.065.
			3. Save these new settings and close the System Settings app.
			4. Open the YouTube app. It should redirect you to a firmware selection page.
			5. Under "Select your firmware version", choose your console's firmware version. Getting this right is very important ! Once you're sure you did it right, hit the Submit button.
			6. Wait for a few seconds. If you did all the previous steps right, the exploit should run and the Homebrew Launcher should load up !

		- IronFall
			Much like tubehax, ironhax requires that your console be on a firmware version between 9.0 and 9.9, and that you have IronFall (previously available for free on the eShop) installed on it.
			Unlike tubehax and ninjhax however, IronFall is not "self-sufficient" : you will need either tubehax or ninjhax to perform the initial ironhax install. The advantage of ironhax is that unlike tubehax, it only requires an internet connection the first time; after that, you'll be free to use it untethered !

			1. First go down to the "preparing your SD card" section and follow those steps, then come back. Don't worry, we'll wait for you !
			
			NOTE : the following steps might be slightly confusing to some people. If you find you're not sure what the steps are referring to, please just head over to the Youtube video showing them being executed here.
			
			2. Setup an initial way to run homebrew on your system, such as tubehax or ninjhax. If you installed ninjhax a while ago, please uninstall it and reinstall it ! Your version might be outdated; installing ironhax requires ninjhax 2.1 or more recent.
			3. Download the ironhax installer. If you downloaded the Homebrew Starter Kit below, you should already have it !
			4. Run the ironhax installer and follow the instructions on screen. Make sure your 3DS is connected to the internet for the install !
			5. Reboot your 3DS and open IronFall. Select the save slot that says "ironhax" and press A. The Homebrew Launcher will start !
